# rosbag-tools

> A ROS-agnostic toolbox for common rosbag operations

This package bundles different tools that can be applied on ROS 1 or ROS 2 rosbags with no dependency on the ROS software stack.

## Installation

```sh
pip install rosbag-tools

pipx install rosbag-tools
pipx install rosbag-tools[plot] # with plot
```
